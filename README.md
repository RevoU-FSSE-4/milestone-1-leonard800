# About this Website
This website is a simple website about a company profile. The company I made is based on MAP and Kanmo which are two famous retail rights holder in Indonesia, Astra due to its distribution of heavy machineries, and Indomobil Group which is part of Salim Group. The website is a simple website about the company short profile and achievements along with the brands that are being brought under my company's umbrella. I also added a career section in the page to look more corporate like along with sliding banner. 
The header, sliding banner change automatically every 5 seconds made possible by using minor javascript
